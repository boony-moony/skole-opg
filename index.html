<h1>Gaming:</h1>
<div class="title">
    Gaming is an act where you play games, When playing theese varied games you can find friends, Often when playing games like "Rust" and "Cs2" its common to find toxic players yelling slurs at you, It is more common to find people cursing at you when online because the people feel safe when behind the screen, They are not as likely to be so mean when they talk to you in real life.
    <h1>Communities:</h1>
<div class="title">
    Communities are often made because people want to talk about the games, problems and tactics togheter, Sometimes the communities will get really toxic and racist like in "Rust", In Rust the people playing it get really competetive and mad at you and often use proximity chat to yell racist slurs at you.
