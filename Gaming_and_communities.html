<h1>Gaming:</h1>
<div class="Maincontent">
    Gaming is an act where you play games, when playing these varied games you can find friends. Often when playing games like "Rust" and "Cs2" its common to find toxic players yelling slurs at you. It is more common to find people cursing at you when online because the people feel safe when they sit behind the screen. The gamers are not as likely to be so mean when they talk to you in real life.
<h1>Communities:</h1>
<div class="Maincontent">
    Communities are often made because people want to talk about the games, problems and tactics together. Sometimes the communities will get really toxic and racist like in "Rust". In Rust, the people playing it get really competetive and mad at you and often use proximity chat to yell racist slurs at you.

<h1>The dark side of communities:</h1>
<div class="Maincontent">
    Some community servers have rules that stop you from saying your racist beliefs to other people, but some servers are echo chambers only allowing the same way of thinking maybe a racist way of thinking and those echo chambers then make people that thinks that their way of thinking is the superior way of thinking, When that type of thinking continues in echo chambers the people may want to inflict harm on others because of their beliefs.
